# Composite Material Mechanics
We propose to host a seminar in autumn, 2022 at MAE, colloege of engineering, SUSTech. Basically, it is designed as a learning seminar instead of a research one. Participants take charge of the seminar in turn, at whose turn he is responsible for presenting topics of Homogenization Theory, Variational Modelling, Numerial Simulation regarding of composite materials. This repository collects slides, speech sripts or even video that appear during this invaluable experience! Wish you enjoy it!
Either giving a lecture or just want to listen to others, send an e-mail to wusm2022@mail.sustech.edu.cn
