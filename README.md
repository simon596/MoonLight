# Composite Material Mechanics
We propose to host a seminar in autumn, 2022 at MAE, colloege of engineering, SUSTech. Basically, it is designed as a learning seminar instead of a research one. Participants take charge of the seminar in turn, at whose turn he is responsible for presenting topics of Homogenization Theory, Variational Modelling, Numerial Simulation regarding of composite materials.
